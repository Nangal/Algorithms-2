Load a 'city' map and display shortest path between two locations.
Map is a char matrix, and characters represent:
	'X' - wall/building
	'0' - locations -> start or destination, only two of them should exist on map
	'.' - part of a road
Distance between each adjacent point is constant, can move up down left right.
