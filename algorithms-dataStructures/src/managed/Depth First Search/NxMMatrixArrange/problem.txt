The goal is to arrange given matrix and print all movements(turns) that lead to solution.

Solution for given 2x3 matrix is :
1 2 3
4 5 6

Solution for given 3x3 matrix is :
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Given matrix can be arranged only in a way that two neighbour elements can be swapped.
Example : 1 can be swapped with 2 and 4,
		  2 can be swapped with 1, 3 and 5
		  5 can be swapped with 4, 6 and 2...
