The goal is to arrange given matrix in least amount of swaps and print all movements(turns) that lead to solution.

Solution for given 3x3 matrix is :
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Given matrix 
1 2 3
9 6 8
4 7 5

Given matrix can be arranged only in a way that members who make '2 x 2 square' could be swapped clockwise.
Example : 
	First incorrect position is 9, matrix can be transformed in state:
	9 is swapped with 6
	Current state:
	1 2 3
	6 9 8
	4 7 5
	6 is swapped with 7
	1 2 3
	7 9 8
	4 6 5
	7 is swapped with 4
	1 2 3
	4 9 8
	7 6 5
	Now we have one incorrect position less, 4 is on correct position
