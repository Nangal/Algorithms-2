# Algorithms, DataStructures and Design Patterns

Repository is simply named Algorithms, but there will be also a design patterns section. Planning to implement the most common used data structures and algorithms in order to understand more what I use every day and how does it work. Beside algorithms and data structures, I am planning to implement commonly used design patterns. Implementations will be written mostly in C++ and C#, in future maybe in F#. 

### Currently implemented
* Singly-linked list
* Doubly-linked list
* Sorting algorithms
* "Ad hoc" problems (Fibonacci sequence, simple string parsing, some COCI rounds tasks - problems )
* Queue, Stack, Deque, RandomizedQueue
* Math expression calculator (infix to postfix conversion, calculating postfix expression in imperative and functional way)
* Towers of Hanoi problem
* Directory Tree, BFS, DFS traversal
* Minimal average subarray
* NokiaComposer parser and sound producer
* Search Query parser based on simple grammar
* Let computer generate random number in [0,100] and develop algorithm which guesses generated number in less or equal to 7 steps
* Dynamic connectivity problem -> various union find algorithms
* Collinear points Bruteforce and Optimized(n2 log n) solution

### Algorithm and DS Competition solutions
* COCI 2016 round 1 Jetpack task
* COCI 2016 round 2 first six tasks

### Will be implemented
* Graphs, graph algorithms and common algorithms like shortest/longest paths, graphs, traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)
* Interesting COCI (Croatian open informatics competition) or Codewars problems
* Common DesignPatterns like AbstractFactory, Command, Strategy, Decorator, Iterator, Singleton and ...
